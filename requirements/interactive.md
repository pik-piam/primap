# Interactive analysis and plotting
## use cases
### selecting data
Selecting datasets by properties of the data, e.g. being above a threshold. Also, selecting data points instead of whole datasets.
### filling in missing data
A researcher fills in data missing in one of the datasets by data from another dataset.
### resampling
Changing the frequency in the time domain (interpolate data existing in 10-year steps to 1-year steps).
### arithmetic
A researcher needs to make a "back of the envelope"-calculation about the impacts of a policy proposal. They query relevant data sets and make calculations, involving basic arithmetic aligned on the indices of the data (i.e. dividing one data set by another where the time axes are aligned automatically).
### visualization
Data sets can be selected by any combination of metadata and data. They can be plotted in common charts by selecting an x-axis and a y-axis.
### tidy format
A data set that is not in tidy format yet can be converted to tidy format for further processing.
### remote or local
Processing is possible on a local laptop as long as the data sets fit into memory comfortably; processing can be moved to a more powerful remote machine when the data sets get too large or the processing gets too complex to comfortably run it on the local machine.
### storing interactive sessions
An interactive session which yielded useful results can be stored for later use.
### consolidating interactive sessions
Parts of interactive sessions which are used often are moved into a common library, so that other researchers can use the functionality more easily.
